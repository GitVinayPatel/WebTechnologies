	A pet store or pet shop is a retail business which sells different kinds of animals to the public. 
	A variety of animal supplies and pet accessories are also sold in pet shops. The products sold include: food, treats, toys, collars, 
	leashes, cat litter, cages and aquariums. Some pet stores provide engraving services for pet tags, which have the owner’s contact information 
	in case the pet gets lost.There are many large pet stores located in the U.S. and Canada, including: Petland, Pet Valu, and PetSmart. 
	In the United States, Petco is also a popular pet store. In addition, there are many smaller pet shops that aren't part of big chains, 
	such as Big Al’s and Pet Food Express, which have a smaller number of locations.
	</p>
	<p>
	Pet stores are extremely popular in today’s society. In 2004, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, 
	in the pet industry, live animal sales reached approximately $1.6 billion. Moreover, in a 2003 survey in the US, merely 38% of 
	U.S. pet shops claimed that they did not sell any live animals.
